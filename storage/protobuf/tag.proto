/*
 * A tag is a `key/value` attribute attached to a piece.
 *
 * Tags can be used to search or filter pieces in storage. If search is not needed, disable it
 * using the `searchable` field.
 *
 * Specific tags are used to implement different higher protocols, such as a file system.
 * Each key should start with a prefix indicating which protocol or application relies on it. Below is a non-exhaustive table of known tag keys:
 *
 * Tag Key      | Description
 * ------------ | -----------
 * content-type | The MIME type of the payload of a piece or file. This is returned by the CDN web interface as HTTP Content-Type.
 * file-*       | Tags to implement a filesystem over object storage. Example: `file-path`
 * kv-*         | Tags to implement a key/value store over object storage.
 * enc-*        | Tags to organize data encryption and data sharing keys.
 *
 * Below is the structure of a tag:
 */
message Tag {
  // The key of the tag. It is usually a UTF-8 string, but it may be any data.
  bytes         key           = 1;
  // The value of the tag for this key. The value should be interpreted based on the key.
  bytes         value         = 2;
  // Whether this tag is searchable or not. Yes by default.
  SearchType    searchable    = 3;
}


// How can this tag be searched.
enum SearchType {
  // RANGE tags should be indexed by nodes into their database to allow efficient queries on a key
  // for an exact value or a range of values. This is the default.
  RANGE             = 0;
  // NOT_SEARCHABLE tags should not be indexed. This option should be set when possible to save
  // node space and speed.
  NOT_SEARCHABLE    = 1;
}
