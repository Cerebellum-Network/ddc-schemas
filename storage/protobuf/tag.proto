 * A tag is a `key/value` attribute attached to a piece.
 *
 * Tags can be used to search or filter pieces in storage. If search is not needed, disable it
 * using the `searchable` field.
 *
 * Specific tags are used to implement different higher protocols, such as a file system.
 * The key should start with a prefix indicating which protocol or application relies on it.
 * Example: `file-path` is used by the file protocol.
